# Create Your Own How-To Video

By creating a short, 3-5 minutes, video tutorial explaining a concept or skill, you are getting valuable practice speaking the language of data science. It requires a higher level of understanding to explain how something works than it does to simply complete a task. Being concise will also be a challenge, and as you practice tightening up your explanation, you will feel more and more comfortable speaking about not only your chosen topic but data science in general. Make sure to watch your video and listen to yourself speaking this new language; this also builds confidence and competence.
